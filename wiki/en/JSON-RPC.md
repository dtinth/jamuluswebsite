# JSON-RPC interface

A JSON-RPC interface is available for both Jamulus client and server to allow programmatic access. To use the JSON-RPC interface, run Jamulus with `--jsonrpcport <port>` option. This will start a JSON-RPC server on the specified port on the localhost.

## Wire protocol

The JSON-RPC server is based on the [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) protocol, using [streaming newline-delimited JSON over TCP](https://clue.engineering/2018/introducing-reactphp-ndjson) as the transport. There are three main types of messages being exchanged:

- A **request** from the consumer to Jamulus.
- A **response** from Jamulus to the consumer.
- A **notification** from Jamulus to the consumer.

## Example

After opening a TCP connection to the JSON-RPC server, the following **request** can be sent:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```json
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"jamulus/getMode","params":{}}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The request must be sent as a single line of JSON-encoded data, followed by a newline character. Jamulus will send back a **response** in the same manner:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```json
{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"mode":"client"}}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Jamulus will also send **notifications** to the consumer:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"jamulusclient/chatTextReceived","params":{"text":"<font color=\"mediumblue\">(01:23:45 AM) <b>user</b></font> test"}}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

> ðŸ¤” Should I list all the methods in the documentation or should I just do thisâ€¦?

## Available methods

To see what methods are available, take a look at these files:

- [`clientrpc.cpp`](https://github.com/dtinth/jamulus/blob/json-rpc/src/clientrpc.cpp)
- [`serverrpc.cpp`](https://github.com/dtinth/jamulus/blob/json-rpc/src/serverrpc.cpp)

For requests from the consumer to Jamulus, search for `pRpcServer->HandleMethod`.

For notifications from Jamulus to the consumer, search for `pRpcServer->BroadcastNotification`.
